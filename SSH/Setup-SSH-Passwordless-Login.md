# How to Setup SSH Passwordless Login in Linux

**SSH** (Secure Shell) allows secure remote connections between two systems. With this cryptographic protocol, you can manage machines, copy, or move files on a remote server via encrypted channels.

There are two ways to login onto a remote system over SSH â€“ using **password authentication** or **public key authentication** (passwordless SSH login).

**In this tutorial, you will find out how to set up and enable passwordless SSH login.**

### Prerequisites

* Access to command line/terminal window
* User with sudo or root privileges
* A local server and a remote server
* SSH access to a remote server via command line/terminal window

#### Before You Start: Check for Existing SSH Keys

You may already have an SSH key pair generated on your machine. To see whether you have SSH keys on the system, run the command:

`ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub`

If the output tells you there are no such files, move on to the next step, which shows you how to generate SSH keys.

In case you do have them, you can use the existing keys, back them up and create a new pair or overwrite it.

##### Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair

* The first thing you need to do is **generate an SSH key pair** on the machine you are currently working on.

In this example, we generate a 4096-bit key pair. We also add an email address, however this is optional. The command is:

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jack@domain.com"`

```
jack@master:~/.ssh$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jack@domain.com"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
```

* Next, type in the location where you want to store the keys or hit **Enter** to accept the default path.

* It also asks you to set a passphrase. Although this makes the connection even more secure, it may interrupt when setting up automated processes. Therefore, you can type in a passphrase or just press **Enter** to skip this step.

```
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jack/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```
* The output then tells you where it stored the identification and public key and gives you the key fingerprint.

```
Your identification has been saved in /home/jack/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/jack/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:croMN764HCp822ayT4m8vEiE+U+myik+eSEwNwzYrQs jack@domain.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|.. .             |
|o . .            |
| o .             |
|E.=              |
|+= o  . S        |
|.oo.. .+         |
|..+o*o+          |
|=++@+X o         |
|+B**&+=.         |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

* Verify you have successfully created the SSH key pair by running the command:

`ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub`

You should see the path of the identification key and the public key, as in the image below:

```
jack@master:~/.ssh$ ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*
-rw------- 1 jack jack 3381 Aug  4 10:43 /home/jack/.ssh/id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 jack jack  741 Aug  4 10:43 /home/jack/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

##### Step 2: Upload Public Key to Remote Server

You can upload the public SSH key to a remote server with the **ssh-copy-id** command or the **cat command**. Below you can find both options.

##### Option 1: Upload Public Key Using the ssh-copy-id Command

To enable passwordless access, you need to upload a copy of the public key to the remote server.

1. Connect to the remote server and use the ssh-copy-id command:

`ssh-copy-ide [remote_username]@[server_ip_address]`

Eg: 

`ssh-copy-id sana@172.168.15.17`

2. The public key is then automatically copied into the **.ssh/authorized_keys** file.

##### Option 2: Upload Public Key Using the cat Command

Another way to copy the public key to the server is by using the **cat** command.

1. Start by connecting to the server and creating a **.ssh** directory on it.

`ssh [remote_username]@[server_ip_address] mkdir -p .ssh`

2. Then, type in the password for the remote user.

3. Now you can upload the public key from the local machine to the remote server. The command also specifies that the key will be stored under the name **authorized_keys** in the newly created **.ssh** directory:

`cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh [remote_username]@[server_ip_address] 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'`

##### Step 3: Log in to Server Without Password

With the SSH key pair generated and the public key uploaded to the remote server, you should now be able to connect to your dedicated server without providing a password.

Check whether the setup works by running the command:

`ssh [remote_username]@[server_ip_address]`

The system should directly log you in to the remote server, no password required.
